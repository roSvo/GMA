            "Info": "The Nightwing is an older model ultra-light, closely resembling those that originated in the late twentieth century. The Nightwing has a shrouded electric motor to minimize aircraft sound and reduce heat emissions—while this has a stated purpose of preventing noise pollution and environmental impact, it has the side effect of making the small, glider-like craft quite stealthy. The Nightwing is popular with rural aviation enthusiasts, smugglers, and anyone who favors a classic stealth insertion."
