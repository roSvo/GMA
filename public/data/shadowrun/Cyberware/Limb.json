These values can only be augmented by cyberlimb enhancements, not other augmentations.<br>You can have your cyberlimb tailored and customized to your frame and musculature. Customization lets you add to your limb’s base Strength and/or Agility ratings. Each increase of either attribute increases the limb’s Availability and cost. If either of your limb’s attributes are increased beyond your natural maximum for that attribute, you can’t use the cyberlimb (so don’t overdo it), but you can still add cyberlimb enhancements. You customize your cyberlimb when you buy it; you can’t customize it after purchase, but you can add enhancements.Cyberlimbs may be either obvious or synthetic.<br><br><b>Cost and Availability</b><li>Multiply by each STR and AGI point above 3</li>"
